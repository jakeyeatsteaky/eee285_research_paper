[ ] From Dataflow Architecture:
    "Despite the advantages, there are no   
    commercially  successful  implementa- 
    tions of the data-driven model. Critiques 
    of  dataflow  argue  that functional  se- 
    inantics and freedom  from  side effects 
    are  nice  for the  programmer.  but  well- 
    known  compiler techniques  applied  to 
    languages like  FORTRAN allow equal 
    exploitation of  parallelism."
